        <h2>One of the favorite dishes in the DR, the Yaroa!!!</h2></P>
            <p>Yaroa is a Dominican street food that originated from Santiago. It is made from French fries or a mash of a root vegetable or tuber such as plantain or yuca, then layered with meat and then cheese. Condiments such as mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard are also often added on top. Beef, pork, chicken, or a combination of the meats is a common part of the dish.There are many versions throughout the country.[3]

            Street food vendors in food trucks often sell the dish.[3] Because it is relatively quick and easy to prepare, it is suitably served as a fast food.[5] It is a popular street food often eaten by young revelers at night in a Styrofoam to-go container. Prior to its creation, the chimichurri burger and sandwich de pierna (pork sandwich) were the main street foods to eat at night.</p>
